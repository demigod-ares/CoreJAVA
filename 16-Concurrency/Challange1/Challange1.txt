• Your task is to create two threads.
• You should make one thread subclass the java.lang.Thread class.
• The other should be created using a Runnable, which you can pass to the Thread constructor. This can be any class that implements Runnable, or a lambda expression.
• Each thread should have a run method. The first thread's code should print 5 even numbers, and the second thread should print 5 odd numbers.
• You should execute them asynchronously, calling the start method on each, in two consecutive statements, in your main code.
• Have your main method, after these threads run a few seconds, interrupt one or both of these threads.
